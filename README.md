# Tag yourself 
## Project description

The purpose of the application is to encourage people to integrate together and share events in their area. The target group is not specified. The principle of the application is very intuitive. It can be used by people of all ages and interests. 
The application is available only for logged in users. Users who do not have an account can register by completing a short form. After logging in to the application, we automatically go to the map view. If we allow the application to access our location, it will automatically display it on the map, otherwise the view will be centered on the student campus. After clicking on the map, we can add a tag (marker with a short description) informing about the event. All the tags we add are listed in the "My Tags" section. It shows the date the tag was added, a description and the number of likes granted by other users. Tags can be filtered according to description, date or number of likes. After clicking on one of them, we automatically go to the map, and the selected tag is red. In addition to adding your own tags, you can also like tags belonging to other users.
